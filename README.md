# RVdb

### Background

The retrovirus database (**RVdb**) is a genomics resource, developed using the **GLUE** software framework, that was developed to support the implementation of retrovirus taxonony in association with Retrovirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (**ICTV**).

The ICTV is the global authority responsible for the classification and naming of viruses. Established in the early 1960s, the ICTV is part of the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS). Its primary objectives are to create a universally accepted virus taxonomy, define virus species and higher taxonomic ranks, and establish standardized virus names. ICTVâ€™s work is essential for organizing the vast diversity of viruses into a coherent classification, aiding in communication and understanding across the virology community.

### Scope and History

RVdb collates information about retrovirus taxonomy, along with sequences, alignments and phylogenies. Via GLUE, phylogenetic reconstructions used as the basis for taxonomic classification are made accessible and re-usable.

### Features

-   **Comprehensive Reference Sequence Set**: Incorporates reference sequence data for all retrovirus species recognised by the ICTV

-   **Integrates ICTV and NCBI reference data**: Integrates NCBI retrovirus reference sequences with ICTV species.

-   **RT Alignment**: Incorporates a codon-based RT alignment that covers all retrovirus species and can be edited in a version-controlled way (via GitHub).

-   **Reproducible RT Phylogeny**: GLUE implements a reproducible process for building the reverse transcriptase (RT) phylogenies on which retroviral taxonomy is based.
